An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time increases linearly with the length of the input.
... If the run time is considered as 1 unit of time, then it takes only n times 1 unit of time to run the array. 
Thus, the function runs linearly with input size and this comes with order O(n). The number of input is proportionate to the time it takes to run.
